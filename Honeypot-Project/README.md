# Honeypot Project

This section documents the deployment and monitoring of a Cowrie honeypot to simulate real attacker behavior in a controlled environment.

This project demonstrates key cybersecurity skills:
- Threat observation  
- Attacker TTP (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures) analysis  
- Log interpretation  
- Behavioral pattern recognition  


## Included Project

### Cowrie SSH/Telnet Honeypot
A medium-interaction honeypot deployed to capture attacker actions and credentials.


## Tools Used
- Cowrie Honeypot  
- Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)  
- Log parsing tools  
- Bash  


## Purpose
The goal of this project is to:
- Observe real-world attacks  
- Understand brute-force behavior  
- Log malicious commands  
- Analyze attacker intent  
- Produce a structured report  

All findings and logs are included in the project subfolder.
