# SIEM Workflow & Use Cases

This project outlines a practical SOC workflow for handling alerts, triaging security events, and writing detection use cases.


## Objectives
- Understand SOC L1 and L2 responsibilities  
- Visualize SIEM alert flow  
- Define alert triage steps  
- Create use cases with detection rules  


## Tools & Files
- `workflow-diagram.png` — SOC workflow visual  
- `usecases.pdf` — documented detection rules  


## Methodology

### 1. Create SIEM Workflow Diagram  
Covers:
- Alert generation  
- Triage  
- Escalation  
- Investigation  
- Closure  

### 2. Define Detection Use Cases  
Each use case includes:
- Threat description  
- Log sources  
- Event IDs  
- Thresholds  
- Detection logic  
- Response steps  

### 3. Simulated Scenarios  
- Brute force login attempts  
- Unusual PowerShell command usage  
- Suspicious network communication  


## Summary
This project demonstrates understanding of:
- SOC operations  
- Alert handling  
- Use case creation  
- Threat detection principles
