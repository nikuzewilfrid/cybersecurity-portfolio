# SIEM Workflow

## Objective
Demonstrate understanding of a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) workflow within a SOC environment.

## SIEM Overview
A SIEM collects logs from multiple sources, normalizes them, correlates events, and generates alerts for security incidents.

## Log Sources
- Windows Security Event Logs
- Sysmon Endpoint Logs
- Network Devices (Firewall, IDS/IPS)

## SOC Workflow
1. Log Collection from endpoints and network devices
2. Log normalization and parsing
3. Event correlation based on rules and patterns
4. Alert generation
5. Incident investigation
6. Incident response and remediation

## Example Use Case
Multiple failed login attempts followed by a successful authentication trigger a brute force alert.

## Analyst Actions
- Validate the alert
- Identify affected systems
- Determine attack scope
- Escalate or remediate incident

## Skills Demonstrated
- SOC operations understanding
- SIEM workflow design
- Incident response methodology
