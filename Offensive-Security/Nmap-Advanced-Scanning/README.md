# Nmap Advanced Scanning

This project focuses on performing a complete and structured Nmap scanning workflow, similar to a real penetration testing reconnaissance phase.


## Objectives
- Identify active hosts  
- Enumerate open ports  
- Determine service versions  
- Detect vulnerabilities using NSE scripts  
- Export, document, and interpret scan results  


## Tools
- **Nmap**
- **NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine)**


## Methodology

### 1. **Ping Sweep**
Used to identify live hosts on the target network.

### 2. **Full Port Scan**
Scanned all 65,535 ports to reveal uncommon services.

### 3. **Service & Version Detection**
Enumerated detailed service information.

### 4. **Script Scanning**
Executed safe NSE scripts to detect:
- Misconfigurations  
- Vulnerable services  
- Outdated software  

### 5. **Output Formatting**
Saved results to both human-readable and machine-readable files.


## Summary
This project demonstrates my ability to perform professional scanning techniques, interpret results, and document them clearly, which is a core skill in both pentesting and red team preparation.
