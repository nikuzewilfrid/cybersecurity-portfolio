# Offensive Security Projects

This section contains practical offensive security exercises focused on reconnaissance, enumeration, vulnerability scanning, and basic exploitation preparation.  
Each project demonstrates the ability to perform structured testing and document findings clearly.


## Included Projects

### 1. **Nmap Advanced Scanning**
A complete network discovery task using multiple scan types and scripts.

**Key Skills:**
- Host discovery  
- Port and service enumeration  
- Version detection  
- NSE script usage  
- Output documentation  

**Files:**
- `scan_results.txt` – raw Nmap outputs  
- `report.pdf` – technical summary  
- `README.md` – explanation of methodology  


### 2. **Basic Web Vulnerability Scan**
Initial web assessment using **Nikto** and **Nmap NSE**.

**Key Skills:**
- Identifying outdated server technologies  
- Detecting common misconfigurations  
- Enumerating directories and server banners  
- Running relevant NSE scripts  

**Files:**
- `nikto_output.txt` – web scan results  
- `nmap_nse_output.txt` – NSE script results  
- `report.pdf` – findings  
- `README.md` – methodology  


## Tools Used
- **Nmap**
- **NSE Scripts**
- **Nikto**
- **Linux CLI**


## Purpose
These projects demonstrate my ability to:
- Perform structured reconnaissance  
- Identify potential attack surfaces  
- Document findings professionally  
- Use industry-standard offensive security tools  


## Next Steps
