# Network Analysis Projects

This section contains hands-on projects focused on analyzing network traffic, understanding protocol behavior, and interpreting packet-level data.  
These activities represent essential skills for SOC analysts, network defenders, and incident responders.


## Included Projects

### 1. **Wireshark DNS & HTTP Traffic Analysis**  
Packet capture investigation of common protocols to identify normal vs. suspicious behavior.

### 2. **TCP/IP Deep Dive**  
Technical explanation of TCP/IP components, encapsulation, and transport mechanisms.


## Tools Used
- Wireshark  
- Packet capture files (pcap/pcapng)  
- Protocol analyzers  


## Purpose
These projects demonstrate my ability to:
- Capture and interpret network traffic  
- Detect anomalies  
- Understand how communication works at different layers  
- Document findings clearly  

Each subfolder includes:
- Raw captures  
- Reports  
- Diagrams  
- Technical explanations
