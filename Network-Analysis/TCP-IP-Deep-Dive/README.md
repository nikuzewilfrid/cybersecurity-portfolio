# TCP/IP Deep Dive

This project studies the TCP/IP model, packet structure, encapsulation, and communication flow.  
It includes diagrams, explanations, and examples of how data moves between layers.


## Objectives
- Understand the TCP/IP model (4 layers)  
- Study packet encapsulation and headers  
- Analyze TCP handshakes (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK)  
- Understand how IP routing works  
- Document concepts clearly  


## Tools & Files
- `tcp_diagram.png` — visual diagram  
- `explanation.pdf` — full technical explanation  


## Key Topics

### 1. TCP/IP Layers
- Application  
- Transport  
- Internet  
- Network Access  

### 2. Encapsulation & Decapsulation  
How data is wrapped with headers as it moves down through layers.

### 3. TCP Communication
- 3-way handshake  
- Session establishment  
- Port numbers  
- Flags (SYN, ACK, FIN, RST)

### 4. IP Addressing  
- IPv4 structure  
- Subnetting basics  
- Default gateways  

### 5. Next Hop Routing  
How packets are forwarded across networks.


## Summary
This project demonstrates strong foundational understanding of networking — a critical requirement for SOC roles, penetration testing, and system administration.
